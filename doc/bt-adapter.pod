=head1 ADAPTER PROPERTIES

string  Address [ro]
        The Bluetooth adapter address (MAC).

string  Alias [rw]
        The Bluetooth adapter friendly name.

uint32  Class [ro]
        The Bluetooth class of device.

boolean Powered [rw]
        Switch an adapter on or off. This will also set the
        appropiate connectable state.

boolean Discoverable [rw]
        Switch an adapter to discoverable or non-discoverable
        to either make it visible or hide it.

        If the DiscoverableTimeout is set to a non-zero
        value then the system will set this value back to
        false after the timer expired.

        In case the adapter is switched off, setting this
        value will fail.

boolean Pairable [rw]
        Switch an adapter to pairable or non-pairable.

        Note that this property only affects incoming pairing
        requests.

uint32  PaireableTimeout [rw]
        The pairable timeout in seconds. A value of zero
        means that the timeout is disabled and it will stay in
        pareable mode forever.

uint32  DiscoverableTimeout [rw]
        The discoverable timeout in seconds. A value of zero
        means that the timeout is disabled and it will stay in
        discoverable/limited mode forever.

        The default value for the discoverable timeout should
        be 180 seconds (3 minutes).

boolean Discovering [ro]
        Indicates that a device discovery procedure is active.

list    UUIDs [ro]
        List of 128-bit UUIDs that represents the available local
