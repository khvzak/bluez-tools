Service		org.openobex
Interface	org.openobex.Manager
Object path	/org/openobex
Object name	OBEXManager

Methods		object CreateBluetoothSession(string target_address, string source_address, string pattern)

			Creates a Bluetooth OBEX session and returns the new session object
			of type org.openobex.Session. Session is automatically connected.
			The target_address represents the remote Bluetooth device,
			source_address specifies which Bluetooth adapter to use
			(to use default adapter, use "00:00:00:00:00:00") and
			the pattern specifies the OBEX service it connects to,
			or the OBEX service using a fixed Bluetooth channel.
			Pattern can be a UUID-128 identifying the service or 
			place holder as "opp" (for Object Push) or "ftp" (for FTP).
			In case you want to use a fixed channel, UUID has to be
			like: UUID:CHANNEL where UUID is a valid UUID or service
			place holder like before, and CHANNEL is an integer
			representing a valid RFCOMM channel. Session object can
			only be used when SessionConnected signal is emitted.
			If connection fails (remote device refuses connection, link dies, etc.),
			SessionConnectError signal is emitted instead. To cancel
			connecting use CancelSessionConnect method.
			
			Returns object path for the created session.
			
			Possible errors: org.openobex.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.openobex.Error.TransportNotAvailable

		object CreateBluetoothImagingSession(string target_address, string source_addres, string bip_feature) {skiped}

			session object of type org.openobex.Session. target_address
			represents the remote Bluetooth device, source_address specifies
			which Bluetooth adapter to use ("00:00:00:00:00:00" for default
			adapter). bip_feature specifies imaging feature to use
			("imagepush" or "remotedisplay"). In case you want to use a fixed
			RFCOMM channel, bip_feature has to be like FEATURE:CHANNEL where
			CHANNEL is an integer representing a valid RFCOMM channel. Session
			object can only be used when SessionConnected signal is emitted.
			If connection fails, SessionConnectError signal is emitted instead.
			To cancel connecting use CancelSessionConnect method.

			and GetUsbInterfaceInfo. profile specifies profile to be used for
			session (FTP profile is commonly used for USB OBEX sessions).
			Session object can only be used when SessionConnected signal is emitted.

Server hierarchy
===============================

Service		org.openobex
Interface	org.openobex.Server
Object path	/org/openobex/server{0,1,2...}
Object name	OBEXServer

Methods		void Start(string path, boolean allow_write, boolean auto_accept)

			Starts OBEX Object Push / FTP server (begins 
			listening for connections). Started signal is emitted after
			the server is started. If error occurs, ErrorOccurred signal is emitted
			instead. Once the server is started, it emits SessionCreated signal
			for every newly connected client.
			
			If this is Object Push server, path defines where all received files
			will be saved. In case of FTP server path is the top-level folder which
			will be served. allow_write specifies whether write operations
			will be allowed (put and delete). In most cases, allow_write should be
			set to True. 
			auto_accept specifies whether incoming files should be always accepted 
			(recommended values: True for FTP, False for OPP). If auto_accept is
			set to False, either Accept() or Reject() has to be called
			every time after you receive TransferStarted signal in ServerSession
			object. If Accept() or Reject() is not called in 15 seconds after
			TransferStarted signal, timeout will happen and the incoming file will
			be automatically rejected. It is important to listen for Cancelled 
			signal on ServerSession object when auto_accept is False because
			you can receive Cancelled signal while waiting for user to accept or
			reject incoming file. This would effectively mean that timeout happened
			and the incoming file was rejected.
			
			Possible errors: org.openobex.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.openobex.Error.NotAuthorized
					 org.openobex.Error.Started

		void Stop()

			Stops the server. All client connections will be closed and

		void Close()

			Closes the server. If server is not stopped, all client connections
			will be closed, operations will be cancelled. Server object will
			be destroyed after that. Closed signal is emitted immediately
			when this method is invoked.
			
			Possible errors: org.openobex.Error.NotAuthorized

		boolean IsStarted()

			Returns true if server is started, false otherwise.
			
			Possible errors: none

		void SetOption(string name, variant value)

			Sets server options. Supported options:
				"Limit" : maximum server sessions that server will accept
						  (0 for no limit). Default is 0. Value type is uint16.

						  thumbnails for uploaded images (specific to BIP servers).
						  Default is False. Value type is boolean.
			
			Possible errors: org.openobex.Error.InvalidArguments

			This signal informs that error occurred while starting or stopping
			the server.

		SessionCreated(object session_object)

			Signal informs that client connected to server and new ServerSession
			object was created. Returns path of ServerSession object.

		SessionRemoved(object session_object)

			Signal informs that client disconnected from server. Returns
			path of ServerSession object that was closed.
