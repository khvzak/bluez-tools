Agent hierarchy
===============

Service		unique name

			In case of incoming transfers it is the filename
			where to store the file and for outgoing transfers
			it is the filename to show the remote device. If left
			empty it will be calculated automatically.

			Possible errors: org.openobex.Error.Rejected
			                 org.openobex.Error.Canceled
