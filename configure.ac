# The default CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS in Autoconf are "-g -O2" for gcc and just
# "-g" for any other compiler. There doesn't seem to be a standard way of
# getting rid of the -g (which I don't think is needed for a production
# library). This fudge seems to achieve the necessary. First, we remember the
# externally set values of CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS. Then call the AC_PROG_CC and
# AC_PROG_CXX macros to find the compilers - if CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS are not
# set, they will be set to Autoconf's defaults. Afterwards, if the original
# values were not set, remove the -g from the Autoconf defaults.
